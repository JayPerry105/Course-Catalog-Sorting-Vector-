Data Structure and Algorithms


    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


The end goal for this course was to create a program that took a list of courses from a university and allowed for the user to both view all courses and their prerequisites and view the same info for any select, single course. Another task within this project was to determine the most efficient data stucture for this program to use. We had to decide between a vector, a hash table, and a tree. I first had to learn what each of these data structures did better and more efficiently than the other. These topics were covered in various weeks leading up to the final two projects. Many of the roadblocks I encountered throughout this course were due to incorrect information and instruction being provided by the creators of the course. My instructor was constantly sending out announcements with corrected files for us to use as source files, such as a csv file.
These projects have helped me get a better grasp on how to make an educated decision in regard to which data structure might be best suited for certain applications. This course did not focus heavily on the actual techniques and practices of writing actual code, rather just on the theory and thought process behind certain data structures and various algorithms. The way I write code has evolved in a way that I tend to think more strategically when it comes to storing data and the most efficient ways to work with said data.
